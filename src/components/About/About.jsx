              For a whole new level of performance, the EOS 6D uses a DIGIC 5+
              Image Processor. Working with two 4-channel A/D converter
              front-end processing circuits, and delivering speeds of up to 4.5
              fps (RAW + JPEG), the DIGIC 5+ Image Processor improves data
              processing performance and features new algorithms that promote
              greater noise reduction at higher ISOs. In addition to
              conventional image processing functions, the DIGIC 5+ Image
              Processor offers real-time compensation for chromatic aberration
              in both still and motion images. With the power of this processor,
              speed improvements are noticeable from the instant the camera is
              turned on and the stunning results speak for themselves.

                The EOS 6D DSLR camera is the ideal tool for unlocking your
                creative vision. It features a 20.2 Megapixel Full-Frame CMOS
                sensor, a wide ISO range of 100-25600, expandable to L: 50, H1:
                51200, and H2: 102400, for incredible image quality even in low
                light, and a DIGIC 5+ Image Processor delivers enhanced noise
                reduction and exceptional processing speed. A new 11-point AF
                including a high-precision center cross-type AF point with EV -3
                sensitivity allows focusing in extreme low-light conditions, and
                with continuous shooting up to 4.5 fps, you are ready to capture
                fast action. Full HD video with manual exposure control,
                multiple frame rates, and the benefits of a Full-Frame sensor
                provides stunning performance and creative flexibility. The
                built-in Wi-Fi® transmitter allows you to wirelessly transfer
                your images to social networking sites through CANON iMAGE
                GATEWAY#, or upload virtually anywhere from your iOS or Android
                smartphone* with the free download of the Camera Connect app**.
                You can use your smartphone for remote camera control and
                operation (with the Camera Connect app), or even print your
                images on a Wi-Fi® compatible printer^. Perfect for travel and
                nature photography, the built-in GPS## allows location data to
                be recorded while shooting. Compact, lightweight, brilliant
                low-light performance, and loaded with easy to use features, the
                EOS 6D is truly the Full-Frame DSLR camera for everyone.

              The EOS 6D features a newly developed Canon Full-Frame 20.2
              Megapixel CMOS sensor for high resolution, perfectly detailed
              images delivered with incredible speed and performance. A 35.8mm x
              23.9mm sensor captures images of 5472 x 3648 pixels with a pixel
              size of 6.55 µm square for fantastic detail and a superior
              signal-to-noise ratio, resulting in great images from the start.
              With no conversion factor, the EOS 6D's sensor ensures that lenses
              mounted on the camera will deliver the same angle of view they
              would on a traditional 35mm camera. Working in tandem with the EOS
              6D's DIGIC 5+ Image Processor, the sensor containing a new
              photodiode structure delivers ISO sensitivities of 100-25600 (with
              expanded sensitivities of L: 50, H1: 51200, H2: 102400) and can
              shoot at up to 4.5 frames per second. Wrapped up in the EOS 6D's
              compact and lightweight body, photography with a full-frame sensor
              has never been so easy and so portable.
