                Apple's thinnest, lightest notebook, completely transformed by
                the Apple M1 chip. CPU speeds up to 3.5x faster. GPU speeds up
                to 5x faster. Our most advanced Neural Engine for up to 9x
                faster machine learning. The longest battery life ever in a
                MacBook Air. And a silent, fanless design. This much power has
                never been this ready to go. It’s here. Our first chip designed
                specifically for Mac. Packed with an astonishing 16 billion
                transistors, the Apple M1 system on a chip (SoC) integrates the
                CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, I/O, and so much more onto a single
                tiny chip. With incredible performance, custom technologies, and
                industry-leading power efficiency,1 M1 is not just a next step
                for Mac — it’s another level entirely.M1 has the fastest CPU
                we’ve ever made. With that kind of processing speed, MacBook Air
                can take on new extraordinarily intensive tasks like
                professional-quality editing and action-packed gaming. But the
                8‑core CPU on M1 isn‘t just up to 3.5x faster than the previous
                generation2 — it balances high-performance cores with efficiency
                cores that can still crush everyday jobs while using just a
                tenth of the power.Up to 7-core GPUThe GPU in M1 puts MacBook
                Air in a class of its own. M1 features the world‘s fastest
                integrated graphics in a personal computer.8 That’s up to 5x
                faster graphics performance compared with the previous
                generation.

                Testing conducted by Apple in October 2020 using preproduction
                MacBook Air systems with Apple M1 chip and 8-core GPU,
                configured with 8GB of RAM and 512GB SSD. The wireless web test
                measures battery life by wirelessly browsing 25 popular websites
                with display brightness set to 8 clicks from bottom. The Apple
                TV app movie playback test measures battery life by playing back
                HD 1080p content with display brightness set to 8 clicks from
                bottom. Battery life varies by use and configuration. See
                apple.com/batteries for more information. 1GB = 1 billion bytes
                and 1TB = 1 trillion bytes; actual formatted capacity less.
                Weight varies by configuration and manufacturing process.
                iMovie, GarageBand, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote are available on
                the Mac App Store. Downloading apps requires an Apple ID and a
                device that is compatible with the OS version required for each
                app.
